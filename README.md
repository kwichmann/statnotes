# My statistics notes
This is a repo for various of my statistics notes. Mostly from a theoretical point of view.

I am mostly self-studying and/or following online courses. My interests varies with time, so files may be left incomplete if my interests happen to change. I tend to spread my interests a bit thin sometimes, but I try to be at least somewhat consistent with putting in work on this.

I am not a professional statistician - my background is in physics and math. These notes are only meant to documents my own work trying to grasp various aspects of the subject. That said, I am currently pursuing a career as a data scientist, so this may skew the subject matter over time.

Therefore, some bits are probably wrong. Other times I have probably not taken the shortest route. As noted, other times, the notes are incomplete.

The notes are typeset with LaTeX, of which I claim to be no master. In fact I've only restarted using it after some years using Word.
I have included some of my old Word notes written in Danish. Mostly for my own sake, but if anyone finds them useful, yay.
