# My statistics notes
This is a repo for various of my statistics notes. Mostly from a theoretical point of view.

I am not a professional statistician. These notes are only meant to documents my own work trying to grasp various aspects of the subject.
Therefore, some bits are probably wrong. Other times I have probably not taken the shortest route. Other times, the notes are incomplete.

The notes are typeset with LaTeX, of which I claim to be no master. In fact I've only restarted using it after some years using Word.
I have included some of my old Word notes written in Danish. Mostly for my own sake, but if anyone finds them useful, yay.

(The category theory that was once included has been moved to another repo)
