# My statistics notes
This is a repo for various of my statistics notes. Mostly from a theoretical point of view.

I am not a professional statistician. These notes are only meant to documents my own work trying to grasp various aspects of the subject.
Therefore, some bits are probably wrong. Other times I have probably not taken the shortest route. Other times, the notes are incomplete.

The notes are typeset with LaTeX, of which I claim to be no master. In fact I've only restarted using it after some years using Word.
I have included some of my old Word notes written in Danish. Mostly for my own sake, but if anyone finds them useful, yay.

Update August 28th 2016: I'm probably spreading myself too thin here, but since I ended up looking a bit into category theory, I've decided to include my notes on this in this repo as well, rather than creating a new one solely for this.
